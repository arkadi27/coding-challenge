I used eclipse to develop the code. After cloning this repo, using Ecipse or you favorite java IDE, simply choose to import an existing Maven Project
Once imported, it may display an error. Just hover your mouse and choose to change JRE to 1.7
That's it - you should be able to run the Tests.java class inside the src/test/java directory.
